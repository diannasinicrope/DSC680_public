Welcome to my data science portfolio! My projects include a selection of technical and analytical projects that can be applied to a variety of industries. While many were created as part of my pursuit of a Master’s from the Data Science program at Bellevue University, some are examples (with faux data) of projects that I’ve created for the online news media industry. Enjoy and please reach out to me at DiannaSinicrope@gmail.com if you have any questions!
